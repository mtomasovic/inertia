# Inertia ⚡

A lightweight browser-based ball navigation game where you guide a ball through treacherous paths while avoiding the abyss!

## What is Inertia?

Inertia is a physics-based puzzle game where you control a ball with realistic inertia and friction mechanics. Navigate through randomly generated maze-like paths from start to finish, but be careful - one wrong move and you'll fall into the dark abyss below!

## Game Features

- **🕹️ Virtual Joystick**: Intuitive gamepad-style joystick control for mobile devices
- **🔥 Burned Trail Effects**: Watch as your ball burns the path behind it, leaving a permanent trail of scorched earth
- **🌌 Dangerous Abyss**: Non-path areas feature an animated dark void with floating danger particles
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Fully responsive gameplay that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations with mobile-optimized scaling
- **📱 Mobile Optimization**: Smaller ball and path sizes on mobile devices for better path visibility and navigation
- **🎯 Random Path Generation**: Each game features a unique, procedurally generated path
- **⚡ Realistic Physics**: Ball movement includes acceleration, friction, and inertia for authentic feel
- **🪶 Lightweight Performance**: Optimized for smooth gameplay on all devices
