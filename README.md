# Inertia ⚡

A lightweight browser-based ball navigation game where you guide a ball through treacherous paths while avoiding the abyss!

## What is Inertia?

Inertia is a physics-based puzzle game where you control a ball with realistic inertia and friction mechanics. Navigate through randomly generated maze-like paths from start to finish, but be careful - one wrong move and you'll fall into the dark abyss below!

## Game Features

- **🎮 Dual Controls**: Play with WASD keys or virtual joystick on mobile devices
- **🕹️ Virtual Joystick**: Intuitive gamepad-style joystick control for mobile devices
- **🌌 Dangerous Abyss**: Non-path areas feature an animated dark void with floating danger particles
- **📱 Responsive Design**: Fully responsive gameplay that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations with mobile-optimized scaling
- **📱 Mobile Optimization**: Smaller ball and path sizes on mobile devices for better path visibility and navigation
- **🎯 Random Path Generation**: Each game features a unique, procedurally generated path
- **⚡ Realistic Physics**: Ball movement includes acceleration, friction, and inertia for authentic feel
- **🪶 Lightweight Performance**: Optimized for smooth gameplay on all devices, especially slower mobile phones

## How to Play

1. **Start**: Your ball begins at the blue starting marker
2. **Navigate**: Use WASD keys or the virtual joystick to move through the green glowing path
3. **Control Options**:
   - **Desktop**: WASD keys for precise directional control
   - **Mobile**: Use the virtual joystick below the game area for gamepad-style control
4. **Avoid the Abyss**: Stay on the path! The dark areas surrounding the path are dangerous

## AI Slop Notice 🤖

This game is **purely AI-generated content** created entirely through AI prompting and assistance. No traditional coding was involved - just pure AI slop generated through conversational prompting with an AI assistant. The entire codebase, game mechanics, visual effects, and **even this README file** were created by describing what was wanted and letting the AI do all the heavy lifting.

*It's AI slop, but it's fun AI slop!*

## Technical Details

- Built with React and Bootstrap
- Uses SVG for graphics and effects
- Responsive CSS with viewport adaptations
