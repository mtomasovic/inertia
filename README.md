# Inertia ‚ö°

A lightweight browser-based ball navigation game where you guide a ball through treacherous paths while avoiding the abyss!

## What is Inertia?

Inertia is a physics-based puzzle game where you control a ball with realistic inertia and friction mechanics. Navigate through randomly generated maze-like paths from start to finish, but be careful - one wrong move and you'll fall into the dark abyss below!

## Game Features

- **üéÆ Triple Controls**: Play with WASD keys, tilt controls, or virtual joystick on mobile devices
- **üïπÔ∏è Virtual Joystick**: Intuitive gamepad-style joystick control for mobile devices
- **üî• Burned Trail Effects**: Watch as your ball burns the path behind it, leaving a permanent trail of scorched earth
- **üåå Dangerous Abyss**: Non-path areas feature an animated dark void with floating danger particles
- **üì± Responsive Design**: Fully responsive gameplay that adapts to different screen sizes and orientations with mobile-optimized scaling
- **üì± Mobile Optimization**: Smaller ball and path sizes on mobile devices for better path visibility and navigation
- **üéØ Random Path Generation**: Each game features a unique, procedurally generated path
- **‚ö° Realistic Physics**: Ball movement includes acceleration, friction, and inertia for authentic feel
- **ü™∂ Lightweight Performance**: Optimized for smooth gameplay on all devices

## How to Play

1. **Start**: Your ball begins at the blue starting marker
2. **Navigate**: Use WASD keys, tilt your device, or the virtual joystick to move through the green glowing path
3. **Control Options**:

## AI Slop Notice ü§ñ

This game is **purely AI-generated content** created entirely through AI prompting and assistance. No traditional coding was involved - just pure AI slop generated through conversational prompting with an AI assistant. The entire codebase, game mechanics, visual effects, and **even this README file** were created by describing what was wanted and letting the AI do all the heavy lifting.

*It's AI slop, but it's fun AI slop!*

## Technical Details
